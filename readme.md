# AUPL - Another Unnecessary Programming Language
(c) 2025 Kevin Knell

**Status:** Experimental / Early Development

AUPL is a free and open-source high-level programming language designed for fast compilation and concise syntax. The language is currently in very early stages and the compiler cannot yet compile programs.

## Overview

- AUPL programs are intended to run in a custom virtual machine (VM).
- Future plans include transpiling AUPL code into C/C++ for native compilation.
- The project is organized into two main parts:
  - `compiler/` namespace: `cmp::`
  - `vm/` namespace: `vm::`
  - The compiler depends on the VM. The VM can run without the compiler.

## Current State

- The compiler is in initial development and does not yet support compiling user programs.
- Running programs or VM usage is not applicable at this stage.
- Building instructions and dependencies will be provided in later releases.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome as the project is in early development. Please check back for contribution guidelines.
